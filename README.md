3D. Everywhere.

Minko is a technology to develop and design rich, interactive and universal 3D applications targeting computers, web browsers and mobile platforms. 

It provides a powerful editor on top of a robust, extensible and fully documented open source core framework, and is created and maintained by [Aerys](http://aerys.in/).

The repository hosts the source code of ***Minko 3***. Looking for Minko 2? We've moved the [repository](http://github.com/aerys/minko-as3).
